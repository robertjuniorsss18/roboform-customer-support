RoboForm offers several ways to get in touch with their customer support team, ensuring that you can choose the option that works best for you. The following are the most common methods for reaching out to RoboForm support:

### 1. **RoboForm Help Center (Self-Service Support)**

If you prefer to resolve your issue without directly contacting support, the **RoboForm Help Center** is a great place to start. The Help Center is a comprehensive resource filled with guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting tips. You can find step-by-step articles on common issues, such as:

- How to reset your master password
- How to set up two-factor authentication
- How to install and use RoboForm on different platforms

This self-service option is perfect if you want to quickly solve an issue without waiting for a response from a support representative.

**How to Use the Help Center:**

1. **Go to the RoboForm website**: Navigate to the official RoboForm website and locate the "Help" or "Support" section at the bottom of the page.
2. **Search for your issue**: Enter relevant keywords related to your problem in the search bar. The system will show you a list of articles and guides that may address your issue.
3. **Browse the knowledge base**: You can browse through the categories or browse for specific issues based on your device or RoboForm product.

If your problem isn’t resolved through the Help Center, you can proceed to contact RoboForm support directly.

### 2. **Contact RoboForm Support via Email**

If your issue requires more personalized help, **email support** is the next best option. RoboForm provides an email address where you can send your inquiries, concerns, or technical issues. This is especially useful for complex problems or issues that require a more detailed explanation.

To get in touch with RoboForm via email, you’ll want to:

1. **Compose a detailed email**: Include all relevant information, such as your account details (without sharing your master password), the issue you're facing, and any troubleshooting steps you've already taken. The more information you provide, the faster the support team can resolve your issue.
   
2. **Send the email**: Send the email to RoboForm’s support address (usually available on their website or within the Help Center).

3. **Wait for a response**: Depending on the volume of requests, it may take a few hours to a day for RoboForm’s customer support team to get back to you with a solution or request more information.

**Tip**: Be clear and concise in your email to help the support team understand your issue quickly. If possible, include screenshots of any error messages or problems you're encountering.

### 3. **Live Chat Support**

For those who prefer a quicker, real-time conversation with a support representative, RoboForm also offers **live chat support** on their website. This is a great option for users who need immediate assistance and don’t want to wait for an email response.

Here’s how to use the live chat feature:

1. **Visit the RoboForm website**: Navigate to the RoboForm support page or the main website.
2. **Click on the live chat icon**: You should see a small chat icon (often at the bottom right corner of the screen). Click on it to start a conversation.
3. **Provide your details**: When prompted, provide your name, email address, and a brief description of your issue.
4. **Chat with a representative**: A RoboForm support agent will respond to you via chat, and you can work together to resolve the issue.

**Tip**: Live chat is ideal for less complex issues or if you need immediate assistance with login problems, technical difficulties, or simple queries.

### 4. **Phone Support**

For some users, speaking directly to a support agent can be more efficient than using email or chat. While RoboForm doesn’t have a toll-free phone number listed prominently, phone support may be available for premium customers or those with complex issues.

To inquire about phone support:

1. **Check your subscription plan**: If you are a premium or business customer, you may be eligible for phone support. Look through your RoboForm subscription details to check if this is an option for you.

### 5. **Social Media Support**

RoboForm is active on various **social media platforms**, and sometimes customer support is provided via social channels. If you’re unable to get help through email or live chat, you can reach out to RoboForm’s social media accounts for assistance.
